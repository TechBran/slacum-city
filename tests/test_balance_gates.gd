## Doc 92 §10's regression gates, made executable.
##
## Doc 92 pass 2 proposed seventeen gates and implemented none of them, on
## purpose: several were supposed to FAIL, because they describe the game after
## the pressure systems are wired rather than before. This file is the after.
## Each `test_gate_NN` below is one row of that table, in table order, and each
## one names the finding it answers.
##
## FOUR THINGS ABOUT HOW THESE RUN, all of which are honesty and not detail:
##
## 1. **Horizon.** Doc 92's table is quoted at 21 game-days × 3 seeds × 6
##    strategies. That whole matrix costs minutes of wall clock; this file gates
##    the three strategies whose rows the findings turn on at doc 92's own
##    21-game-day horizon on one seed, and says so per gate. The full matrix is a
##    merge-time job for `tools/playtest.gd`; the delivery report carries it.
## 2. **Path.** These drive the coarse step ONLINE (`BalanceGateRig`), not as an
##    offline catch-up. The rig's header explains why in full; the short version
##    is that doc 08 §2.3 rule 1 suppresses the Disaster Director for the whole
##    of a catch-up session, so an all-catch-up run cannot see the pressure these
##    gates exist to measure.
## 3. **Metric.** Doc 92 §3 reports two money columns — `treasury` (cash) and
##    `value created` (cash + construction spend) — and warns that cash alone
##    ranks a spend-everything agent wrongly. With doc 02 §2.6 wear live, the
##    warning inverts: the harness's scripted agents take exactly ONE action per
##    game-hour, the maintenance queue is never empty once a city is large, and a
##    maintaining agent therefore spends half its action budget repairing instead
##    of building. `value created` now rewards the agent that lets the city rot,
##    for a reason that lives in `tools/playtest.gd`'s action budget and not in
##    the sim. Gates that doc 92 quoted on `value` are gated on BOTH columns
##    where both hold, and on cash with a named reason where they do not.
## 4. **Deferred gates.** Three of doc 92's rows need a ruling this pass did not
##    receive — two are `data/starter_city.json` shape edits (F-4, F-8) and one is
##    an unruled command-layer gate (pass-1 F-7). Those tests PIN today's measured
##    value with a loud comment naming the ruling they wait on, so the day the
##    ruling lands the gate fails and gets its real threshold. They are marked
##    `_deferred_` in the method name so nobody mistakes a pin for a pass.

# ======================================= 3, 5, 6 the control the game must beat

## GATE 3 — `do_nothing`'s 21-game-day treasury is an UPPER bound and must have
## fallen. Doc 92 measured $199,427 (mean of seeds) for a city that never saw an

## GATE 5 — **the headline.** Playing well beats not playing, on the cash column
## a player actually sees AND on value created. Doc 92 measured the opposite by a
## wide margin: the control ended three game-weeks with 11× the "competent"
## agent's cash, because every pressure system in the game was unwired.

# ================================================= 4, 7, 8, 9 pressure systems

## GATE 4 — `balanced` beats `disaster_neglect`. These two agents are the SAME
## class with one field changed (`maintains`), so the whole difference is the
## maintenance verb. Doc 92 measured neglect ahead on EVERY axis — cash, value,
## population, happiness, stability — while spending $0 on maintenance, because
## `apply_decay` had no caller and there was nothing to maintain.
##
## Gated on cash, condition and the two city-health columns. NOT on
## `value created`: see the file header — with wear live, the harness's
## one-action-per-game-hour budget means a maintaining agent spends roughly half
## its actions repairing, so the agent that lets the city rot converts more
## dollars into buildings *inside this horizon*. That is a `tools/playtest.gd`
## artifact (the fix is to let `Balanced.act` take a maintenance action AND a
## build action in the same game-hour), and it does not survive contact with a
## longer run. Measured, seed 1337, same rig:
##
## | game-day | balanced treasury / value / pop / minC / destroyed | neglect |
## |---|---|---|
## | 21 | $480,480 / $847,620 / 811 / 0.848 / 0 | $48,038 / $1,296,719 / 1,860 / 0.452 / 0 |

##
## The neglect knob is fatal; it takes five game-weeks. A city left to rot loses
## 285 buildings to fire — condition feeds `Building.fire_condition_mult`
## (1 + 1.5·(1−c)^1.5) and `state_fire_mult` 1.8 for damaged, so a rotten city
## ignites far more often than a maintained one and the fires spread.

# ==================================================== 12 the tax curve (§9 F-5)

## GATE 12 — the top tax detent is a tradeoff, not a free lunch. Doc 92 F-5
## measured `tax_squeezer` (= `balanced` with the slider pinned to
## `TAX_RATE_MAX`) at +46 % value created for a happiness number that changed
## nothing else, and ruled `tax.TAX_RATE_GROWTH_COEFF` 3.5 → 8.0 so the detent
## costs a city rather than a decimal.
##
## Measured as a CONTROLLED PAIR rather than as a strategy comparison, because a
## strategy comparison cannot isolate it: the two agents earn different money and
## therefore build different cities, which is exactly what doc 92 §6/§7 built the
## micro-experiments for. Here both cities get the SAME build plan on the SAME
## tiles from the same seed, and the ONLY difference is the detent.
##
## **THE FINDING THIS GATE WAS WRITTEN AGAINST, AND ITS FIX.** Pass 2 shipped the
## ruled coefficient — `growth_rate_multiplier(TAX_RATE_MAX)` is 0.44 — and it
## bit nothing, because doc 03 publishes the multiplier into
## `PopulationSystem.advance` where it scales only the RELAXATION RATE:
##
##     attractiveness += (target − attractiveness) × (1 − exp(−dt·mult/τ))
##
## `attractiveness_target(s) = clamp((s − 0.35)/0.50, 0.25, 1.0)` is **1.0 for any
## stability ≥ 0.85** and a founding city starts AT 1.0, so `target −
## attractiveness` was 0 and the multiplier scaled zero: this same controlled pair
## used to end 2, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 game-days with **the same 224 people**, and
## only the treasury moved. No value of `TAX_RATE_GROWTH_COEFF` could fix that,
## because the rate lever cannot move a city that is already where it is going.
##
## **Doc 09 amendment T-1** adds the missing half: the TARGET is now the most
## binding of three ceilings — stability, lived happiness, and the tax bill —
## `min(A_stab(S), A_happy(H), attractiveness_tax_factor(r))`, where the tax
## factor is priced off `happiness_tax_delta` so the slider is read exactly once
## in the whole coupling. The top detent's −15.4 happiness points become a 0.7998
## attractiveness ceiling, the city relaxes DOWN to it, and the slider finally
## costs residents instead of a decimal. Measured, seed 1337, same pair:
##
## | game-day | detent 5 pop / treasury | detent 12 pop / treasury |
## |---|---|---|
## | 1 | 224 / $13,485 | 198 / $26,896 |
## | 3 | 224 / $38,470 | 182 / $69,652 |
## | 7 | 224 / $86,415 | **179** / $147,073 |
## | 21 | 222 / $211,882 | **177** / $359,430 |

## did not receive, and that file is not in this agent's named keys).
## PROPOSED: first `E_UNSERVED` for `greedy_growth` before game-hour 48, once the

## its 1,429 buildable tiles, so the fastest possible builder does not hit the
## wall for two game-weeks and `cmd_place_grid_component` — doc 93 §A's "THE
## game" — is optional for the whole pacing horizon. This PINS today's value: it

## under F-8 and expected it to need a `data/starter_city.json` edit (trim the
## nine READY founding blocks to four or five). It did not: doc 92 measured 0.3
## blocks because the "competent" agent was too poor to expand, not because it had
## nowhere to go. With the pressure systems wired the same agent ends three
## game-weeks with a real war chest and expands on it. F-8's map question is still

## the build sheet's `locked` flag is a UI courtesy the sim does not enforce —
## `data/buildings.json` gives `apartment` L1 `min_city_level` 1, so enforcing it
## would change which archetypes exist at city level 0 and re-price every curve in
